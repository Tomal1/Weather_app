# Weather app

This is also a rebuild using react, this time the app incoparats two third party API's insead of one ([Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/)) & ([React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/)).
The app automatically identifys the clients location using geo-location and passes the information back to open weater map API, which will generate a lat/long & pass the value back to react lealet to render a visual map.
